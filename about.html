## About

At 11 years of age I had the first contact with programming on the ZX Spectrum 128k, although I did not even know a word of English, I was very intrigued to realize how the games were made.
In the secondary I graduated as a computer technician, where the passion for programming grew.
I dropped out of superior college and started working in a local industry, where I would become general foreman. At the time, I developed a database that controlled the entire production and customer management process. Later I returned back to studies superior in Computer Engineering, but i took on a challenge of forming a team for a new olive factory and accompanying it for 2 years. In 2012 I decided to head to the capital and taking advantage of my second passion for mechanics and became a designer, where I quickly evolved into a leading designer.
I am currently developing my programming skills and for this I am to Oracle certification in JAVA.
