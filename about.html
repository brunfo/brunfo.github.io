## About

At 11 years of age i had the first contact with programming on the ZX Spectrum 128k, although i did not even know a word of English, i was very intrigued to realize how the games were made.
In the secondary i graduated as a computer technician, where the passion for programming grew.
I dropped out of superior college and started working in a local industry, where i would become general foreman. At the time, i developed a database that controlled the entire production and customer management process.
Later i returned back to superior studies in Computer Engineering, but i took on a challenge of forming a team for a new olive factory and accompanying it for 2 years.
In 2012 I decided to head to the capital and taking advantage of my second passion for mechanics and became a designer, where quickly evolved into the leading designer.
Currently, i'm developing my programming skills and for this, i'm studying for Oracle certification in JAVA
